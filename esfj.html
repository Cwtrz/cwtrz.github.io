            <h3>WHO IS AN CONSUL (ESFJ)?</h3>
            <P>
		    <br>
            A Consul (ESFJ) is a person with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They are attentive and people-focused, and they enjoy taking part in their social community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others.
                <br>
                - "Encourage, lift, and strengthen one another. For the positive energy spread to one will be felt by us all."    
                <br>
                For Consuls, life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. People with this personality type form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – to friends, loved ones, and neighbors.
                <br>
                This doesn’t mean that Consuls like everyone, or that they’re saints. But Consuls do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them. Generous and reliable, people with this personality type often take it upon themselves – in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together.

            What is an  personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li> Individuals with this personality type tend to place a high value on tradition, rules, and security. Maintaining the status quo is important to ESTJs, and they often become involved in civic duties, government branches, and community organizations. </li>
            <li> Because of their orthodox approach to life, an ESTJ can sometimes be seen as rigid, stubborn, and unyielding. Their take-charge attitude makes it easy for ESTJs to assume leadership positions. </li>
            <li> Their self-confidence and strong convictions help ESTJs excel at putting plans into action. However, at times, they can appear critical and overly aggressive—particularly when other people fail to live up to their high standards. </li>
            <li> People often describe ESTJs as predictable, stable, committed, and practical. They tend to be very frank and honest when it comes to sharing their opinions, which can sometimes be seen as harsh or overly critical. </li>
        </ul>
