            Intuition is sometimes described as a “sixth sense.” Unlike logical or deductive methods, it involves knowing without being able to explain the means of arriving at that understanding; the “how” of intuition is concealed from the knower. Consequently, in a way similar to sense perceptions, we tend to experience intuitions as given rather than as products of conscious effort.
            <br>
            Carl Jung proposed two varieties of Intuition—Extraverted Intuition (Ne) and Introverted Intuition (Ni)—which he classified as perceiving functions. Moreover, type theory informs us that all “NP” types (i.e., ENFP, ENTP, INFP, INTP) use Ne, and “NJ” types (i.e., INFJ, INTJ, ENFJ, ENTJ) Ni, as either their dominant or auxiliary function.
            <br>
            Unfortunately, due to fact that Ne and Ni both exhibit certain general features of Intuition, many people fail to properly distinguish and identify them. To combat this confusion, this post will explore key Ne-Ni differences, as well as ways in which these functions can masquerade as one another.
            <br>
            Because ENPs (i.e., ENTP & ENFP) and INJs (i.e., INTJ & INFJ) utilize intuition as their dominant function, we will use them as respective representatives of Ne and Ni throughout much of our discussion.  <b> But first, lets introduce Ni and Ne functions separately :</b>

                    Intuitive (N) judging (J) types employ Introverted Intuition (Ni) as either their dominant or auxiliary function. Malcolm Gladwell has cleverly described intuition as a process of “knowing without knowing” that is, of having the sense that we know something, but without a full understanding of how we came to know it. Such is the experience of NJ types, whom Ni perpetually imbues with a sense of “knowing” and insight into things.
                    <br>
                    As we discussed earlier, Ni operates convergently rather than divergently. Instead of creating an ever-expanding web of connections like Ne, it extracts core insights and develops convergent explanatory models. It’s a process of distillation, of distinguishing what’s lasting and essential from what’s arbitrary, fleeting, or anomalous.
                    <br>
                    In response to Ni’s convergent workings, NJs commonly report a strong sense of intuitive knowing and conviction. While their NP counterparts are inclined to see Ne’s ideas as potentially or provisionally valid, NJs experience Ni’s insights as self-evidently true and trustworthy.
                    <br>
                    The “mind’s eye” is a popular symbol for intuitive knowing and in-sight, which is why I chose the eye to represent Ni. They enjoy tinkering with ideas, perspectives, theories, visions, stories, symbols, and metaphors.
                    <br>
                    Because it does much of its work subconsciously, Ni can seem to have a certain magical quality about it. In fact, it is not unusual for INJs to be viewed as having some degree of psychic or prophetic abilities. Despite its magical appearance, Ni can be understood on a rational basis.
                    <br>
                    Ni knowing contributes to NJs’ effectiveness as thought leaders, theorists, executives, counselors, advisors, consultants, and the like.

                    Intuitive (N) perceiving (P) types use Extraverted Intuition (Ne) as either their dominant or auxiliary function. As we discussed above, Ne is a divergent form of intuition, specializing in generating lots of ideas, connections, and possibilities. Compelled to explore all the available options and possibilities, making firm and final decisions can be particularly challenging for NPs.
                    <br>
                    According to Wikipedia, divergent thinking is “a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions.” Due to Ne’s ability to prodigiously make new and unprecedented connections, NPs outperform other types on several measures of creativity.
                    <br>
                    Merriam-Webster defines “ideating” as “forming an idea or conception of.” In art, ideation refers to the early stages of the creative process as explored through sketching, prototyping, or brainstorming. This seems to perfectly capture the role of Ne, which is to generate ideas and conceptual possibilities.
                    <br>
                    The verbal expression of Ne often resembles brainstorming aloud. When orating, NPs may not always seem to “have a point” as they meander from one idea to the next. To other types, Ne can seem random, distractible, quirky, or flighty.
                    <br>
                    Extraverted Intuition scans for relationships or patterns within a pool of ideas, facts, or experiences.
                    <br>
                    Ne also enjoys imagining and speculating about what could be. Its interest in envisioning future possibilities gives NPs a good nose for fields like art, design, marketing, inventing, and entrepreneurship.

            To understand how Jung approached these two functions, it helps to first gain a sense of his view of Introversion and Extraversion. Namely, Jung saw Extraversion as operating in a broad and expansive fashion. This is exemplified by the fact that Extraverts tend to have shorter attention spans and frequently shift their focus from one thing to the next. Their social relationships and interactions are also more extensive in nature, characterized by breadth rather than depth. Jung viewed Introversion as more intensive and focused. Instead of constantly shifting or extending their attention, Introverts dive deeper by investing more of their time and energy into a handful of things they really care about.
            <br>
            In this light, Extraverted Intuition can be considered more expansive and less focused than Introverted Intuition. Types who lead with Ne (i.e., ENPs) generally display a greater breadth of hobbies and extraverted activities than Ni dominants (i.e., INJs). Quintessential dabblers and dilettantes, ENPs are often good at many things, but their breadth of interests may prevent them from achieving mastery in any one area. INJs, by contrast, are more apt to develop expertise in a specific subject or discipline.
            <br>
            Ne is also more divergent / scattered in its ideation, commonly bouncing from one idea or topic to the next, whereas Ni likes to linger on a single theme of discussion whenever possible. INJs would rather penetrate more deeply into a topic than explore the “rabbit trails” that are constantly beckoning the Ne user. Ni is more convergent, zeroing in on ONE theme or conclusion. Ne generates myriad options and possibilities, which is why P-types are known for “keeping their options open.”
