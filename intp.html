            <h3>WHO IS AN LOGICIAN (INTP)?</h3>
            <P>
                <br>
                A Logician (INTP) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. 
                These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. <BR>
                They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity. <BR>
                Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can’t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe <br> 
                – which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren’t afraid to stand out from the crowd.
