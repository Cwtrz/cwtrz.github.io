            <h3>WHO IS AN MEDIATOR (INFP)?</h3>
            <P>
            <br>
            
            A Mediator (INFP) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do. <br>
            
            Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them<br>
            
            Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.<br>

            <br> <br>
            What is an infp personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>INFPs are known to be introverted, quiet, and reserved. Being in social situations can drain their energy, and they prefer interacting with a select group of close friends. While they like to be alone, this should not necessarily be confused with shyness.2 Instead, it simply means that INFPs gain energy from spending time alone. On the other hand, they have to expend energy in social situations.</li>
            <li>An INFP typically rely on intuition and are more focused on the big picture rather than the nitty-gritty details. They can be quite meticulous about things they really care about or projects they are working on but tend to ignore mundane or boring details.</li>

            <li>Their place an emphasis on personal feelings, and their decisions are more influenced by these concerns rather than by objective information.</li>
            <li>When it comes to making decisions, INFPs like to keep their options open. They often delay making important decisions just in case something about the situation changes. When decisions are made, they are usually based on personal values rather than logic.</li>
