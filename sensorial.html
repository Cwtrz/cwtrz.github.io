            Extraverted Sensing (or what Jung called Extraverted Sensation) occurs by way of the five primary senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste).
            Introverted Sensing (Si), by contrast, relates to inner bodily sensations such as pain, hunger, thirst, internal temperature, numbness, tingling, muscle tension, etc. Both Se and Si are critical for our physical survival, delivering vital sensory feedback from within and without.
            <br>
             At first glance, it may seem strange that some people would display stronger extraverted senses and some stronger introverted senses, but this is really no different than other individual differences. There have surely been times in our evolutionary past in which a well-developed Se was more beneficial to survival, as well as times where Si proved especially important. 
            <br>
            Consequently, having both Si and Se types would have improved the odds of our survival as a species, allowing us to receive and monitor a broad swath of sensory data. Se types, for instance, were likely better suited for hunting tasks because of their ability to notice and respond to important details in the environment. Si types, by contrast, may have been better at discerning whether food or water was poisonous because of their inner sensitivity.
            <br>
            Despite the important role of Extroverted and Introverted Sensing in mediating basic physiological perception, this is not their sole purpose. More broadly, Se can be understood to involve a concern for the concrete events happening around us. This not only includes noticing sensory details such as sights, smells, and movements, but also things like trends, fashions, and styles. While all personality types rely on vision for everyday functioning, Se types seem especially attuned to visual input. This is why they (SPs) tend to be more concerned about their appearance, as well as appearances in general, than Si types (SJs) are.
            <br>
            SPs seek pleasure and Se takes great pleasure in perceiving both physical beauty and sensory novelty. Their penchant for sensory novelty is why SPs are commonly described as thrill-seekers or hedonists. Se is also engaged by physical action. SPs love perceiving and physically responding to environmental cues. This why they often take up work as first responders, athletes, mechanics, chefs, and the like.

                    Sensing (S) judging (J) types use Introverted Sensing (Si) as either their dominant or auxiliary function. Si trusts what it knows. And what it knows is what it recalls from past experience—from memories, traditions, affiliations, established routines, etc. In contrast to the future orientation of Ne, the values and decisions of Si are guided by the past. Rather than trying something new, Si prefers to play it safe, sticking with established beliefs and behaviors. More than other types, SJs find comfort and pleasure in the known and familiar.
                    <br>
                    Familiarity confers a sense of safety and security for SJs. If they can perpetuate the past into the present and future, they know what to expect and can plan accordingly. Their preference for stability and predictability contributes to SJs’ loyalty and reliability in all aspects of life—whether as friends, spouses, parents, or employees. In the workplace, Si aids with attention to detail, adherence to established rules and procedures, and quality control. It’s particularly useful in legal, clerical, administrative, and related fields.
                    <br>
                    However, regardless of whether you are a Sensor or an Intuitive, you will use Sensing to a greater or lesser degree. For example, an ESTP has Sensing as their preferred function. An ENTP, on the other hand, will not pay as much attention to information coming in through their senses, but they can still tap into these skills when they need them. All aspects of personality exist on a spectrum – they are not absolute.  
                    <br>
                    So now we’ve explained the ‘S’ part of Si. Where does the ‘i’ part of the symbol come from? This letter tells you how you use your Sensing – whether it is processed internally (Introverted Sensing or Si) or whether it is proudly outward for the world to see (Extraverted Sensing or Se). More on this below.
                    <br>
                    The last piece of the puzzle decides whether your personality uses Si as a dominant function or an auxiliary, secondary or supporting, function. ISJ’s have Si as their dominant cognitive function and ESJ’s have Si as their auxiliary cognitive function.

                    When someone interacts with the world through an Se function, their focus remains on the present, on the here-and-now. What they observe and experience is more real than anything else, and their ideas about truth and virtue always remain grounded in that reality.
                    <br>
                    People who use Extraverted Sensing experience intense emotions connected to their sensory experiences. They are often connoisseurs of great art, all types of music, and the most delicious culinary treats. They may embrace alternative healing methodologies that involve physical movement or therapeutic contact, such as yoga, Tai Chi, massage therapy, acupuncture, or Reiki. They usually enjoy sports and other challenging outdoor and indoor activities that test their limits and force them to develop their physical skills. 
                    <br>
                    Extraverted Sensors are often visual and kinesthetic learners, and can absorb information much more readily if it is demonstrated rather than explained – or better yet, if they can learn directly through hands-on experimentation.
                    <br>
                    ESTPs and ESFPs use Extraverted Sensing as their primary function, while ISTPs and ISFPs have it as a secondary function. This has an obvious and decisive influence on the behaviors, attitudes, and lifestyle choices of these types.

            <br>
            Since Introverted Sensing is a Perceiving function, it can be understood, much like Introverted Intuition (Ni), as acting rather passively and outside of conscious control. Like INJs, SJs often experience a strong sense of conviction, a gut feeling about whether some is true or false, right or wrong. This, without having really done much as far as conscious reasoning to arrive at such conclusions. So while Si types may seem stubborn or closed-minded, they may feel that they have little as far as free choice in what they believe. This is why Jung considered Si an irrational function. Not because its conclusions are necessarily irrational, but because of the unconscious way it receives information and draws conclusions.
            <br> 
            An excellent example of the irrational element of Introverted Sensing can be found in the book, The Woman Who Can’t Forget. There, the author explains her uncanny ability to accurately recall the details of each and every day of her life, including related historical dates and events. While her powers of memory are undoubtedly unprecedented, what is most telling with regard to her Si is that fact that she cannot control it. She reports feeling great frustration because her mind is constantly replaying memories in a random fashion, despite her best efforts to eliminate them and focus on the present. 
            <br>
            Even if extraordinary, her experience speaks to the passive, involuntary way in which Si in records and recollects information. This helps to explain why Si dominant types seem to effortlessly recall all sorts of random details and facts. Their recall is simply too quick to be attributed to conscious effort. Such displays of effortless and accurate memory why many non-Si types may see ISJs as unusually intelligent.
            <br>
            Finally, while Ni and Si are both irrational functions, Si is less synthetic and creative than Ni. Si more or less preserves and relays information in its original form. Ni acts more synthetically, weaving together disparate information to construct novel theories, visions, and insights.
