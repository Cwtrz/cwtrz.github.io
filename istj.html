            <h3>WHO IS AN LOGISTICIAN (ISTJ)?</h3>
            <P>
		        <br>
                A Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.
                <br>
                "I’d be more frightened by not using whatever abilities I’d been given. I’d be more frightened by procrastination and laziness."
                <br>
                Logisticians pride themselves on their integrity. People with this personality type mean what they say, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through.
                <br>
                This personality type makes up a good portion of the overall population, and while Logisticians may not be particularly flashy or attention-seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable foundation. In their families and their communities, Logisticians often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical, even in the most stressful situations.

            <li> They like to carefully plan things out well in advance. They enjoy an orderly life. They like things to be well-organized and pay great attention to detail.

            <li> They take a logical approach to achieving their goals and completing projects and can work steadily toward accomplishing these tasks. They can ignore distractions to focus on the task at hand and are often described as dependable and trustworthy. </li>

            <li> While ISTJs are loyal and protective, their tendency to be direct and honest sometimes leads to hurt feelings. Others may feel that they are insensitive or even cold. </li>
            <li> Because they are responsible and hardworking, they also tend to take on unwarranted self-blame when things go wrong. </li>
        </ul>
