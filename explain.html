        <h1>Concealed vs Expressed</h1>
        <p>
            <br>
            Concealed / Introverted Functions: Ni, Si, Ti, Fi <br>
            Expressed / Extraverted Functions: Ne, Se, Te, Fe <br>
            This distinction is fairly obvious and easy to understand. Extraverted (E) functions, by definition, are directed outwardly, while the introverted (I) functions are directed inwardly. Extraverted functions are more overtly expressed and readily observed. Introverted functions, in being largely concealed, are harder to discern from without. <br>
            As I’ve noted elsewhere, this can lead to misunderstandings about introverts since their dominant function, which is introverted in nature, isn’t readily revealed or discerned. Instead, what people typically encounter is introverts’ extraverted auxiliary function, which is neither their strongest nor most preferred function. At any rate, this is important to understand when engaging with and typing introverts. <br>

        <h1>Judging vs Perceiving</h1>
        <p>
            <br>
            Judging Functions: Ti, Fi, Te, Fe <br>
            Perceiving Functions: Ni, Si, Ne, Se <br>
            The judging functions help us make decisions and draw conclusions. They involve a desire to control, predict, order, or otherwise shape the course of things. When using a judging function, we may close ourselves off to new information (i.e., shut down perceiving) in hopes of advancing toward goal, answer, or decision. <br>
            The perceiving functions are responsible for taking in or retrieving information. Observing birds, smelling flowers, reading novels, and recalling something from memory are examples of perceiving activities. The perceiving functions are less concerned with actively shaping or controlling and might thus be seen as more passive than their judging counterparts. <br>
            Judging and perceiving functions can be concealed (I) or expressed (E). Types with a judging (J) preference outwardly express judging through either Fe or Te and may thus seem more firm, serious, and forthright. Types with a perceiving (P) preference display Se or Ne and often appear more casual, open, and flexible. <br>

        <h1>Autonomous vs Shared</h1>
        <p>
            <br>
            Autonomous: Fi, Ti<br>
            Shared: Fe, Te <br>
            This category is less frequently discussed than the first two, but relates to the age-old distinction between the individual and the collective. While the specifics will differ according to whether we’re discussing thinking or feeling, the underlying structure is the same. <br>
            Fi and Ti, used primarily by FPs and TPs respectively, are both autonomous functions insofar as their reasons (Ti), values (Fi), and methods are derived from within. Hence, their judgments may at times seem more idiosyncratic or unorthodox than those of Fe or Te. <br>
            As extraverted functions, Fe and Te, used primarily by FJs and TJs, are oriented to shared or collective norms. Fe aligns itself with F norms like social customs, manners, gestures, etc. Its judgments also have a stronger interpersonal bent than those of Fi. Te judgments are guided and informed by pre-established technical, scientific, legal, or organizational standards. Whereas Ti is inclined to invent its own standards and methods, Te generally trusts that standardized procedures are there for a reason, namely, that they have proven to be fundamentally sound and reliable. <br>
            In reading this, one might get the sense that Ti and Fi are a bit more rebellious, while Te and Fe are more conforming. I don’t think this is entirely wrong, especially if we’re careful to delineate the context in which this is true (e.g., Ti being more rebellious or “freethinking” in T matters, Fi in F matters). That said, when it comes to ideas, intuition (N) is strongly associated with originality and unconventionality, which means that NJs are also disposed to unorthodoxy, even if they don’t wear it on their sleeves. <br>
            Lastly, while there may be some ways in which the S and N functions are classifiable as autonomous or shared, this distinction is, in my view, more applicable to the judging functions. The perceiving functions are better described in terms of convergence and divergence, which we’ll now discuss. <br>
