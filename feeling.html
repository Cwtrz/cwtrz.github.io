            <br>
            As with all of the dichotomy pairs, both feeling functions do share some general similarities, which is why many people can recognize that they are feelers, and just aren’t sure which kind. In short, all feelers are (or tend to be) value driven, conflict avoidant, emotionally intelligent, and people-focused. (When we say “people-focused”, we don’t mean social). Both can be selfish or ego-centric.
            <br>
            Fe works broadly and extensively, while Introverted Feeling (Fi) penetrates more deeply and intensively. Fe is more concerned with collective morale, while Fi focuses more on the feelings of the self or a select few individuals. Like FJs, FP types (who use Fi as their dominant or auxiliary function) tend to prefer external harmony, but this is more reflective of their personal discomfort with conflict (i.e., their own disquieting feelings) than of a genuine concern for interpersonal harmony
            <br>
            As usual, it’s worth noting that people are distinct and varied (based on other factors like environment, and life experiences) so an Fi user may not relate to all of the Fi differences. Similarly, the Fe user might not relate to all of the Fe differences. However, as a general rule, one should relate to the majority of the traits for their specific cognitive function.
            <br>
            Fi users look to self to form their own opinions. This doesn’t mean that they never seek advice, but ultimately, they will have an easier time forming an opinion quickly based on their own core values, without taking the group into account.
            <br>
            On the other hand, Fe users will tend to reserve their opinion while seeking out the opinion of the group and those around them. They will naturally look to others first, rather than taking a stance based solely on self. They will probably leave all but the most important preference opinions open and subject to change depending on certain context and scenarios.

                    Feeling (F) perceiving (P) types use Introverted Feeling (Fi) as either their dominant or auxiliary function. As we discussed earlier, Fi is directed inwardly, navigating and managing personal feelings and values on a largely independent basis. While Fe relies on others for emotional support and kinship, Fi is more autonomous in managing emotional matters. When FPs do opt to express their feelings and values, they often do so indirectly—be it through active (S), creative (N), or rational (T) channels.
                    <br>
                    Nevertheless, I decided to describe Fi as “valuing” for a couple reasons. The first is that, more than any other function, Fi has a natural appreciation for life itself—especially things like nature, children, and animals. No one needs to teach FPs about the value and sanctity of life because they already feel it on a deep, innate level. Indeed, many common FP causes—child welfare, environmentalism, vegetarianism, animal rights, etc.—are merely extensions of their Fi core values.
                    <br>
                    FPs also use their personal values as a compass for navigating life. Although Fi values may overlap with Fe collective values, FPs will go against the cultural grain if something doesn’t sit right with them. Recognizing the importance of having the liberty to follow their own values, FPs are typically happy to extend the same freedom to others. They also tend to appreciate the diverse expressions and ways of life that emerge when individuals (and cultures) march to the beat of their own drummer.
                    <br>
                    If Fi involves an inner intensity of feeling or attention to feelings, it is reasonable to ask what sorts of things are stimulating to Fi. In other words, what provokes emotional responses and reactions in FP types? Although there a certainly myriad things that can impact Fi emotions, FPs seem particularly affected by children (especially their own), animals, music, novels, injustices, and the sick and needy. 
                    <br>
                    They seem particularly moved by those who can’t help themselves—those with special needs, the disabled, impoverished, and, of course, children and animals. All of these things, be they good or bad, can invigorate Fi and are consequently perceived as meaningful to FP types.
                    <br>
                    FPs’s manage their feelings and values on a largely independent basis. While Fe turns to others for emotional support and kinship, Fi deals with emotional matters independently. When IFPs do opt to outwardly express their feelings, tastes, or values, they often do so through other functions in their functional stack.

                    Feeling (F) judging (J) types use Extraverted Feeling (Fe) as either their dominant or auxiliary function. The extraverted nature of Fe is illustrated by the fact that FJs are the most emotionally expressive and communicative of all types.
                    <br>
                    As we touched on earlier, Fe is less emotionally autonomous than Fi. This is true in two senses. First, Fe is quicker to turn to others for emotional support. In many respects, simply talking about their emotional concerns feels therapeutic for FJs. Second, Fe always keeps a close eye on social norms to discern the “socially appropriate” words or emotions for the situation. They’ll often put their own emotions on the backburner (assuming they’re aware of them) to ensure they blend with the social context. While this may seem inauthentic or disingenuous to Fi types, it helps to establish the social cohesion and connections FJs care about.
                    <br>
                    In addition to calibrating itself to the social context, Fe excels at reading and mirroring others’ emotions. This makes it a powerful tool for achieving Fe’s foremost concern: establishing emotional rapport with others. Without solid interpersonal connection, the rest of Fe’s agenda—advising others, improving morale, building consensus, etc.—is apt to prove ineffective.
                    <br>
                    Fe also inspires FJs to notice and meet the needs of others. FJs want to know that everyone is getting along and is treated humanely and hospitably. They also enjoy offering counsel and advice, especially on spiritual, personal, or interpersonal matters
                    <br>
                    The Feeling functions also relate to the development of various tastes. Tastes are qualitative preferences—likes and dislikes. This is another reason Feeling types are drawn to exploring arts and culture, providing them with plenty of raw material to engage their Feeling function. Working with people and animals can be stimulating for similar reasons.
                    <br>
                    Extraverted Feeling (Fe) is the dominant function of the ENFJ and ESFJ types and the auxiliary for INFJ and ISFJ types. Like Extraverted Thinking, Fe is considered an extraverted Judging function. Whereas the extraverted Perceiving functions (e.g., Ne) express things in an open-ended fashion (e.g., “What do you think about…?” or “I wonder if …”), the extraverted Judging functions typically utilize declarative statements (e.g., “I feel…” or “I don’t like…”).

           Fi users look to self to form their own opinions. This doesn’t mean that they never seek advice, but ultimately, they will have an easier time forming an opinion quickly based on their own core values, without taking the group into account.
           <br>
           On the other hand, Fe users will tend to reserve their opinion while seeking out the opinion of the group and those around them. They will naturally look to others first, rather than taking a stance based solely on self. They will probably leave all but the most important preference opinions open and subject to change depending on certain context and scenarios.
           <br>
           A key distinction between Fi and Fe is the direction of their emotional awareness. Fi is an introspective function, closely relating one’s emotions to one’s identity. As a result, Fi users (especially the dominants) tend to be in a constant state of self-searching. They strive to understand their core self and mold themselves into their ideal person. As a result, these types tend to be naturally aware of their own personal feelings, and tend to relate to others by somehow drawing a connection back to self. This sometimes causes them to project their own personal feelings onto someone else.
           <br>
           Whereas, Fe users are naturally more in tune with the emotions of those around them. They tend to naturally hone in on the emotional responses of others. They are sensitive to these responses, and are prone to adapting their behaviors accordingly. This may lead some people to call them doormats, since they tend to be more likely to go out of their way for someone else. Fe users tend to be naturally good at responding to others in an emotionally appropriate way, based on the perceived needs and expectations of the person in question.
