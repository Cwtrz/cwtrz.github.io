            <h3>WHO IS A DEBATER (ENTP)?</h3>
            <P>
                <br>
                A Debater (ENTP) is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter.
                <br>
                Quick-witted and audacious, Debaters aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up people with this personality type more than a bit of verbal sparring – and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better.
                <br>
                It would be a mistake, though, to think of Debaters as disagreeable or mean-spirited. Instead, people with this personality type are knowledgeable and curious, with a playful sense of humor, and they can be incredibly entertaining. They simply have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun – one that involves a healthy dose of spirited debate.

        <h1><br><br>Key behavior of ENTPs</h1>
        <p>
            <br> <br>
            What is an ENTP personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ENTPs enjoy interacting with a wide variety of people. They are great conversationalists and love to engage other people in debates.</li>
            <li>They are more focused on the future rather than on immediate details. They may start projects and never finish them because they are so focused on the big picture rather than the present needs.</li>
            <li>ENTPs are immensely curious and focused on understanding the world around them. They are constantly absorbing new information and ideas and quickly arriving at conclusions. They are able to understand new things quite quickly.</li>
            <li>One common myth about ENTPs is that they love to argue simply for the sake of arguing. While people with this personality type are often willing to play the devil's advocate at times, they enjoy debates as a way of exploring a topic, learning what other people believe, and helping others see the other side of the story.</li>
        </ul>
