            <h3>WHO IS AN DEFENDER (ISFJ)?</h3>
            <P>
		    <br>
            A Defender (ISFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be warm and unassuming in their own steady way. Theyâ€™re efficient and responsible, giving careful attention to practical details in their daily lives.
                <br>
                "Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others."
                <br>
                In their unassuming, understated way, Defenders help make the world go round. Hardworking and devoted, people with this personality type feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. Defenders can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes.
                <br>
                This is a capable, can-do personality type, with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, Defenders also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. Defenders are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives.

        <h1><br><br>Key behavior of ISFJs</h1>
        <p>
            <br> <br>
            What is an  personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> One of their greatest strengths is their ability to notice the people and events happening around them. While people with this personality type are introverted and tend to be quiet, they are keen observers and focused on others. Because they are so perceptive, ISFJs are good at remembering details about other people. </li>
            <li> One challenge that ISFJs have to grapple with is their tendency to repress or ignore emotions. Those with this personality type are particularly well-tuned into the emotions and feelings of others. </li>
            <li> An ISFJ practicality can be another key strength, but it can also be a weakness when it limits their ability to consider new ideas. People with this personality prefer concrete facts over abstract theories. As a result, they tend to learn best by doing. </li>
            <li> ISFJs enjoy structure and strive to maintain this order in all areas of their lives. They thrive in highly structured and consistent environments where they are given step-by-step instructions and clear expectations. </li>
        </ul>
