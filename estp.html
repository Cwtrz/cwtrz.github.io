            <h3>WHO IS AN ENTEPRENEUR (ESTP)?</h3>
            <P>
		        <br>
                An Entrepreneur (ESTP) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them. They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits.
                <br>
                "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all."
                <br>
                Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend.
                <br>
                Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don’t keep Entrepreneurs interested for long. Entrepreneurs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, to just go out and do it. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.

        <h1><br><br>Key behavior of ESTPs</h1>
        <p>
            <br> <br>
            What is an  personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> When confronted by problems, people with this personality type quickly look at the facts and devise an immediate solution. They tend to improvise rather than spend a great deal of time planning. </li>
            <li> ESTPs don't have a lot of use for abstract theories or concepts. They are more practical, preferring straightforward information that they can think about rationally and act upon immediately. </li>
            <li> They are very observant, often picking up on details that other people never notice. Other people sometimes describe them as "fast-talkers" who are highly persuasive. In social settings, they often seem like they are a few steps ahead of the conversation. </li>
            <li>  ESTPs are not planners. They react in the moment and can often be quite impulsive or even risk-taking. This 'leap before they look' attitude can be problematic at times and it may lead them to say or do things they regret. </li>
        </ul>
