            <h3>WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE (ESTJ)?</h3>
            <P>
		        <br>
                An Executive (ESTJ) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity.
                <br>
                "Good order is the foundation of all things."
                <br>
                Executives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths.
                <br>
                Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.

        <h1><br><br>Key behavior of ESTJs</h1>
        <p>
            <br> <br>
            What is an  personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Individuals with this personality type tend to place a high value on tradition, rules, and security. Maintaining the status quo is important to ESTJs, and they often become involved in civic duties, government branches, and community organizations. </li>
            <li> Because of their orthodox approach to life, an ESTJ can sometimes be seen as rigid, stubborn, and unyielding. Their take-charge attitude makes it easy for ESTJs to assume leadership positions. </li>
            <li> Their self-confidence and strong convictions help ESTJs excel at putting plans into action. However, at times, they can appear critical and overly aggressiveâ€”particularly when other people fail to live up to their high standards. </li>
            <li> People often describe ESTJs as predictable, stable, committed, and practical. They tend to be very frank and honest when it comes to sharing their opinions, which can sometimes be seen as harsh or overly critical. </li>
        </ul>
