            <h3>WHO IS AN ARCHITECT (INTJ)?</h3>
            <P>
                <br>
                An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.
                <br>
                “Thought constitutes the greatness of man. Man is a reed, the feeblest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.”
                <br>

                It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.

            <br> <br>
            What is an INTJ personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>INTJs tend to be introverted and prefer to work alone. They're self-confident and hard-working, which is a strength. However, it can also be a weakness as they may come across as insensitive or callous.            </li>
            <li>An INTJ looks at the big picture and likes to focus on abstract information rather than concrete details. They also tend to be a perfectionist.            </li>
            <li>Someone with an INTJ personality places greater emphasis on logic and objective information rather than subjective emotions. Talking about emotions makes them uncomfortable.            </li>
            <li>INTJs like a world with control and order. As a result, they prefer to make plans well in advance. Some INTJs may even employ manipulation to get a specific outcome.            </li>
        </ul>
