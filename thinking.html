            Fi types (i.e. INFP and ENFP types) will often confuse Te types because they may logically come to the same conclusions but in practice will still go with what they feel like doing in the moment — since they are dominant Fi types (Introverted Feelers). But Ti types will confuse Te types for a different reason; when Te and Ti types attempt to debate objective logic, Ti usually takes the stance that (e.g. everything and nothing is true, depending on how you approach or look at it). 
            <br>
            As a result of this, Ti types can consider everything true whenever they decide it. This often confuses the Te types because it’s a fundamentally different way of approaching the logic of the universe. So when Te types try to figure out what exactly the Ti types “believe” or “think” about a subject or topic, they can never grasp it and view it as always changing moment-by-moment along with their Ti personal logic.
            <br>
            This is often where the most disagreements come between Te and Ti types. Te types may have a hard time grasping what the Ti type’s stance actually is in a debate or discussion about ideas, because they assume the Ti type is like them (i.e. coming at it from a Te point of view). And because Ti types don’t naturally externalize how they come to conclusions, the Te types will be left unsatisfied with the Ti type’s argument.
            <br>
            The reason for this lies in the functions themselves and how they interact. As mentioned in the things to keep in mind, all Te types have Fi (Introverted Feeling) and all Ti types have Fe (Extroverted Feeling) — even if it is their inferior function. Fi is like an anchor to personal values, and Te is like an adherence to an objective truth — Ti types with Fe lack both that anchor and adherence. Te types will be the first to come across that lack of adherence, and Fi types will be the first to come across that lack of anchor to values.
            <br>
            Instead, Ti types have the ability to be unattached to a “truth”. This allows them to explore ideas without the risk of attaching themselves, their identities, or their emotions to it; it keeps them from developing blinders so they can bring unique perspectives to the table and keep the other types on their toes.

                    Thinking (T) perceiving (P) types employ Ti as either their dominant or auxiliary function. It’s helpful to think of Ti as an innate proclivity for logical reasoning—be it spatial, mathematical, or otherwise. Readers who are school teachers are probably familiar with the notion of “number sense” and how it’s naturally stronger in some students than others. Likewise, logical thinking is second nature for TPs, allowing them to independently reason their way through logical challenges. TPs (especially ITPs) are your quintessential “Do-It-Yourself” or “Go-It-Alone” types, which is why, in our earlier discussion, I classified Ti as an autonomous function vis-à-vis Te.
                    <br>
                    “Reasoning,” per the Oxford dictionary, involves “thinking, understanding, and forming judgments by a process of logic.” Moreover, the term “reason” has long been associated with the discipline of philosophy, and many famous philosophers were likely INTPs. Philosophy has also served as a haven for “freethinkers,” for those brave enough to scrutinize the assumptions of even the most widely accepted beliefs or paradigms. This highlights the critical and probing nature of Ti thought (especially when partnered Ne), which I discuss at length in my two INTP books.
                    <br>
                    That said, we must be careful not to bias our view of Ti too far in the direction of NTP abstraction. The truth is that Ti is just as relevant and useful for engaging with practical (S) problems as it is for abstract (N) ones; STPs tend to focus more on the former, NTPs on the latter. STP athletes, surgeons, and mechanics, for instance, use Ti reasoning to make decisions about the concrete situation before them. NTPs apply Ti more abstractly—tinkering with ideas, theories, designs, etc.
                    <br>
                    As an introverted function, Ti relies on its own inner logic and manufactures its own ways of doing things. In many respects, this makes Ti a more portable and versatile function. Instead of referencing external protocols and “doing things by the book” (Te), Ti is confident in its ability to spontaneously and independently figure things out. Characteristically clever and innovative, Ti can engineer hacks or workarounds in nearly any situation.
                    <br>
                    While Ti is useful for navigating the concrete world and solving practical challenges, it can also be applied conceptually and theoretically, especially when coupled Extraverted Intuition (Ne), as seen in INTPs and ENTPs. It is largely Ti that compels NTPs to understand the essence of things, including their essential self, purpose, and philosophy.
                    <br>
                    While all the judging functions (i.e., Ti, Fi, Te, and Fe) work to establish firm beliefs, methods, or values, because Ti is both an introverted and a thinking function, it is particularly concerned with those that are essential or foundational.

                    Thinking (T) judging (J) types utilize Extraverted Thinking (Te) as either their dominant or auxiliary function. Interpersonally, Te involves the outward expression of rational judgments and assertions; TJs literally “think out loud.” Expressing themselves firmly and frankly, they’re your quintessential “straight shooters.”
                    <br>
                    Te aims to rationally understand external systems / structures, to diagnose their shortcomings, and to make them more efficient and effective. At home, Te may oversee activities like planning, labeling, organizing, and finances. In the workplace, it may be used to streamline and optimize processes, or even to restructure an entire organization. To do so effectively, Te draws on empirical data and established methods and procedures.
                    <br>
                    Unlike TPs, TJs prefer not to improvise, but would rather employ proven ways of doing things. That said, NTJs in particular will jettison or work to revise existing standards when necessary, but this is typically a product of their intuition more than Te.
                    <br>
                    Te’s proficiency with “structuring” activities contributes to TJs’ success in work that involves planning, organizing, mapping, or quantification. This may include careers in a broad array of fields such as law, business, finance, science, management, technology, etc.
                    <br>
                    Te strives to make the external world and its operations more rational, employing precise definitions, policies, plans, and procedures. From the Te perspective, nothing can be optimized unless we work to objectively understand and control it with standard operating procedures. Such standards should always be clearly explicated to minimize ambiguity and the potential for interpretative error. Toward this end, TJ types often end up managing businesses or organizations. ENTJs, in particular, are highly represented among CEOs, with ESTJs and ISTJs gobbling up the middle-level management positions.
                    <br>
                    TJs may also be drawn to various teaching and training roles. I have personally encountered numerous ISTJ elementary school teachers, and research has shown INTJs commonplace among college professors. Generally speaking, TJs enjoy work that allows them to order, organize, and manage information or operations.

            Te types (i.e. ENTJ and INTJ types) will often point out logical inconsistencies in an argument and state exactly why such is the case. In response to this, Ti types (i.e. ENTP and INTP types) will often jump in to play devil’s advocate and try to poke holes whenever they hear objective absolute statements; they need to make sure all angles are being explored and nothing is left out, especially if someone decides to make an absolute statement.
            <br> 
            Unlike TPs, TJs prefer not to improvise, but would rather employ proven ways of doing things. That said, NTJs in particular will jettison or work to revise existing standards when necessary, but this is typically a product of their intuition more than Te.            
            <br>
            Ti types will argue for the sake of exploring an idea, while Te types will argue to get an objective point across. As a result, Ti will often argue points they don’t even believe in — for the sake of exploration and learning.
            <br>
            Ti types tend to only externalize their conclusions, not how they came to those conclusions. Te type externalize both their conclusions and how they came to them — to make sure they are objective and repeatable and are correct with observable reality. Te types enjoy talking out their logic with others and have no issue doing so when asked. Ti types on the other hand sometimes find it tricky to externalize how they came to their conclusions.
