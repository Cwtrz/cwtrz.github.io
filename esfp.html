            <h3>WHO IS AN ENTERTAINER (ESFP)?</h3>
            <P>
		        <br>
                An Entertainer (ESFP) is a person with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities.
                <br>
                "Live for each second without hesitation."
                <br>
                If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as Entertainers when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style.

        <p>
            <br> <br>
            What is an ESFP personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> ESFPs prefer to learn through hands-on experience and tend to dislike book learning and theoretical discussions. Because of this, students with ESFP personality types sometimes struggle in traditional classroom settings. However, they excel in situations where they are allowed to interact with others or learn through direct experience. </li>
            <li> ESFPs live very much in the here-and-now and sometimes fail to think about how current actions will lead to long-term consequences. They will often rush into a new situation and figure things out as they happen. They also tend to dislike routine, enjoy new experiences, and are always looking for a new adventure. </li>
            <li> ESFPs are perceptive when it comes to other people. They are able to sense what others are feeling and know how to respond. People tend to find them warm, sympathetic, and easygoing. </li>
            <li> While ESFPs do not shun the spotlight, they are more interested in simply living in the present and doing what feels right at that moment. </li>
        </ul>
