            <h1>Functions</h1>
            <P>
                 When most people think about "Myers-Briggs," they think of the personality test, and the four letters associated with their resulting personality type: introverted (I) or extroverted (E), intuitive (N) or sensing (S), thinking (T) or feeling (F), and judging (J) or perceiving (P). But these traits only tell part of the story, a very short and non-detailed one. Did you know you also have four key MBTI functions that correspond to your type?
            </P>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="tp">
        <h1>Theory and Practice</h1>

        <p>The starting point is Carl Jung’s theory of cognitive functions. He identified four of them, which he labeled as sensation, intuition, thinking, and feeling. He asserted that everyone would have both a primary function and a supporting or auxiliary function and that understanding each would reveal the secrets of how each person absorbed and processed information and used it to evaluate options and make decisions.
            <br>
            Using Jung’s ideas as a template, Isabel Briggs Myers modified the Myers and Briggs personality typing system to include eight cognitive functions — twice as many as Jung identified.  She kept Jung’s initial four functions (identified by the letters S, N, T, and F in the Myers-Briggs typing system), but added ‘extraverted’ and ‘introverted’ options for each (signified by ‘e’ or ‘i’ in lower case).
            <br>
            So an ENFJ, to give one example, would have an extraverted Feeling function (Fe) and an introverted Intuition function (Ni). Conversely, an INFP would have an introverted Feeling function (Fi) and an extraverted Intuition function (Ne).
            <br>
            To clarify: extraverted or introverted in this case do not refer to how outgoing someone is (or isn’t). Instead, they relate to the outward or inward focus of each function. Extraverted functions express themselves through an immersion in the external world, while introverted functions are defined by a process of inner self-reflection. More on that in a moment. 
        </p>
        
    </div>

    <div class="tp">
        <h1>Interaction with the four-letters</h1>

        <p>
            Isabel Briggs Myers kept the idea of a dominant (primary) and auxiliary (supporting) function as an essential element of her system. But she gave those concepts more depth and context, through two added stipulations:
        </p>

        <ul class="a">
            <li>For each person, their personality would determine the identity of the dominant function. In practice, this means that an Introvert will always have an introverted dominant function, while an Extravert will always have an extraverted dominant function.</li>
            <li>The cognitive functions divide into perceiving and judging categories. The perceiving functions (Sensing and Intuition) explain how people receive and absorb information, while the judging functions (Thinking and Feeling) explain how they make decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each person has one cognitive function for both the perceiving and judging categories, since both processes are required for human thinking and behavior. But Judgers will always have an extraverted-Judging function, while Perceivers will always have an extraverted-Perceiving function.
            <br>
            Whether or not that function is dominant depends on whether a person is an Extravert or an Introvert. Extraverted Perceivers will have a dominant perceiving function, but the perceiving function will fill an auxiliary role in Introverted Perceivers. Likewise, Extraverted Judgers will have a dominant judging function, while Introverted Judgers will have an auxiliary judging function.
            <br>
            All of this might sound complicated. But that’s only because people are complicated. The good news is that once you’ve decoded your personality type and identified your cognitive functions, you’ll possess valuable insights that can help you do a deep dive into your own psyche.
