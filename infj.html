            <h3>WHO IS AN ADVOCATE (INFJ)?</h3>
            <P>
                <br>
                
                An Advocate (INFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.<br>
                
                “Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.” <br>
                
                Advocates (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world. <br>

        <p>
            <br> <br>
            What is an INFJ personality like in everyday life? Here are a few key characteristics: <br><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> With their strong sense of intuition and emotional understanding, INFJs can be soft-spoken and empathetic. This does not mean that they are pushovers, however. INFJs have deeply held beliefs and the ability to act decisively to get what they want.</li>
            <li> While they are introverted by nature, people with an INFJ personality type can form strong, meaningful connections with other people. They enjoy helping others, but they also need time and space to recharge. </li>
            <li> What sets the INFJ apart is their ability to translate their idealism into action. They don't just dream about changing the world—they make it happen.            </li>
            <li> People with an INFJ personality type like to exert control by planning, organizing, and making decisions as early as possible. </li>
            <li> When making decisions, INFJs place a greater emphasis on their emotions than objective facts. But this doesn't mean they see the world through rose-colored glasses. INFJs understand the world, both the good and the bad, and hope to be able to make it better.</li>
        </ul>
